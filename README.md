# Personal Dockerfile

Most images can be found at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/zhusj/).

Most images are only customized for me. For example, I only use SQLite3 in
the container and the capacity to use MySQL is removed.

I aim to build the smallest container, and I always use Alpine as the base
image.
